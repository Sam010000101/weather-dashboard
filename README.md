# Weather Dashboard
This is my weather dashboard.

## Description 
Using the OpenWeather API I have developed a weather dashboard that enables the user to enter a city via a text input to receive a current weather report and a five day weather forecast for each city input.

Temperature, windspeed & Humidity are displayed along with weather icons. All data is retrieved from the OpenWeather API using multiple Ajax get methods that retrieve JSON for the searched city before appending it to the relevant HTML IDs (in some cases prepending). Most of the dashboard is generated using JavaScript.

Search history is stored to Local Storage and assigned to search buttons for quick access to weather data for previously searched cities .
